# Mock Lego store

Created to show case the use of page routing in React using react-router-dom. This web application allows user to browse real lego products in a mock up store. While this is a mock store, it allows users to browse and select various Lego sets. Narrow down your choices by theme, or filter by price. Due to its use of components, this web application can easily be modified to include more products, new themes, or an entirely different collection of products.
